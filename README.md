## Features

- Detects obstacles in the user's path using an ultrasonic sensor
- Generates different beeps based on the distance of the obstacle from the user
- Provides tactile feedback through a vibrating motor when the obstacle is very close
- Helps blind individuals become more independent and improve their quality of life

## Technologies

- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Vibrating motor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- 9V battery

## Installation

1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino UNO board as follows:
   - VCC to 5V
   - GND to GND
   - Trig to pin 9
   - Echo to pin 10
2. Connect the buzzer to the Arduino board as follows:
   - Positive leg to pin 11
   - Negative leg to GND
3. Connect the vibrating motor to the Arduino board as follows:
   - Positive leg to pin 12
   - Negative leg to GND
4. Connect the 9V battery to the Arduino board to power the device.

## Usage

To use the blindstick, turn on the device and hold it in front of you as you walk.The ultrasonic sensor will detect objects in your path and provide feedback through the buzzer and vibrating motor.
